### Setting it up
To setup Ping on Join, all you need to do is run the following command on your server:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Command
bao poj
```
</CodeGroup>

<img src="/images/poj.png"/>

You can use the dropdown menu to select which setting you want to edit.
You can either enable/disable Ping on Join, edit the message and edit the delete after time.

The delete after time just means after how long the message should get deleted.
Leaving this at 0 seconds will never delete the message.
