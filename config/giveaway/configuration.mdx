### Editor

To use the configuration editor, use the following command:
<CodeGroup>
```javascript Command
/giveaway
```
</CodeGroup>

You can change every single thing about your giveaways using this command.

<img src="/images/gw_config.png"/>

For more custom variables ([user_mention], [claimtime], etc.) visit [this resource](/resources/variables).

### Custom Embed Editor

Here is how the custom embed editor looks like:

<img src="/images/gw_embed_editor.png"/>    

You can use the dropdown to change the author, thumbnail, title, description, image, footer and color of the embed.

You can refer to [this graphic](/resources/embed_layout) if you are unsure which embed setting does what.

You can also refer to [this resource](/resources/variables) to see what variables you can use in the embed editor.
