<img src="/images/gw_embed_editor.png"/>

You can use the dropdown to change the author, thumbnail, title, description, image, footer and color of the embed.

You can refer to [this graphic](/resources/embed_layout) if you are unsure which embed setting does what.

You can also refer to [this resource](/resources/markdown) to see what markdown you can use in the embed editor.
