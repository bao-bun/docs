### What Custom Contents do
Custom Contents let you define **reusable messages and embeds** that the bot can send automatically.  
You can control:

- Message text
- Embedded messages
- Variables and dynamic data
- Reuse across multiple features

Custom Contents allow you to change messages **without reconfiguring every command**.


## Step 1: Create new content
Start by creating a new piece of custom content.

<CodeGroup>
```js Syntax
/content create <content_name> <content_type>
```
</CodeGroup>

- `content_name` is the name used to reference the content
- `content_type` defines how the content behaves

Examples include `gw` (giveaway), `welc` (welcomer), `doj` (dm on join), and other supported types.
You can select the types on the dashboard and in the slash command interface.

Choose a descriptive name so it's easy to recognize later.


## Step 2: Set the content message
After creating the content, define what it should send.

<CodeGroup>
```js Syntax
/content message <content_name> [message]
```
</CodeGroup>

- `message` is the text sent when this content is used
- Leaving `message` empty clears the message

You can include variables such as:

- `[user.mention]`
- `[user.name]`
- `[server.name]`

Learn more about available variables in the [Variables Guide](/resources/variables).

## Step 3: (Optional) Customize an embed
If your content supports embeds, you can fully customize how it looks.

<CodeGroup>
```js Syntax
/content embed <content_name>
```
</CodeGroup>

- Opens an interactive embed editor
- Allows you to customize title, description, colors, and fields
- Embeds can also contain variables


## Step 4: View your content
Preview your content before using it in a feature.

<CodeGroup>
```js Syntax
/content view <content_name>
```
</CodeGroup>

- Shows the current message and embed
- Variables are previewed when possible

This is useful for catching mistakes early.


## Step 5: Use your content
Once created, your content can be used in:

- Welcomer
- DM on Join
- Giveaways

Example usage:

- `/welcomer content welcome-message`
- `/dm content welcome-dm`
- `/giveaway winner-message winner-message`


## Step 6: Edit content type (optional)
You can change how a content behaves after creation.

<CodeGroup>
```js Syntax
/content type <content_name> <content_type>
```
</CodeGroup>

- Useful if you want to switch between message-based or embed-based content


## Step 7: Remove content (optional)
If a piece of content is no longer needed, you can delete it.

<CodeGroup>
```js Syntax
/content remove <content_name>
```
</CodeGroup>

- This permanently removes the content
- Any features using this content will need to be updated


## Example setup
A typical setup might look like this:
- Create content named `welcome-message`
- Set a message using variables
- Customize an embed
- Assign the content to Welcomer

Commands used:
- `/content create welcome-message message`
- `/content message welcome-message Welcome [user.mention] to **[server.name]**!`
- `/content embed welcome-message`
- `/welcomer content welcome-message`


## Tips and best practices
- Use the dashboard for easier management and editing
- Use descriptive and easy to recognize content names
- Preview content before assigning it


## Troubleshooting
If content does not appear correctly:
- Make sure the content exists
- Verify the content type is correct
- Check variable spelling closely
- Use `/content view` to preview output
