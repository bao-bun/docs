## Explanation
The purge command can be used to delete many messages at once.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
/purge <amount>
```

```javascript Example
/purge 15
// This will delete exactly 15 messages including your own.
```
</CodeGroup>

## Flags
Our purge command currently has two flags:
- `--before=<message_id>`: This flag will delete all messages before the message with the given ID.
- `--after=<message_id>`: This flag will delete all messages after the message with the given ID.

So for example, you can do:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Syntax
/purge <amount> --flag=<message_id>
```

```javascript Example 1
/purge 15 --before=1350856648046153807
// This would delete 15 messages that were sent before the given ID.
```

```javascript Example 2
/purge 25 --after=1350856648046153807
// This would delete 25 messages that were sent after the given ID.
```
</CodeGroup>
